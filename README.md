This project is a playful, animated login form that enhances user interaction through creative and dynamic animations. Utilizing GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), the form animates facial elements, such as eyes, mouth, and arms, in response to user input in the email and password fields. The eyes follow the caret's position in the email input, and the mouth morphs into different shapes based on the input's validity (e.g., detecting the "@" character for email validation). When the password field is focused, the arms "cover" the eyes in a whimsical gesture to simulate privacy, uncovering them when focus is lost. The project incorporates fluid animations, easing effects, and real-time tracking to deliver an engaging user experience that feels intuitive and entertaining. With its combination of functional feedback and delightful visual elements, the project stands out as a creative approach to improving traditional login forms.
